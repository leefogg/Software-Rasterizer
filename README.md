# Software Rasterizer
This project is for educational purposes and aims to describe modern graphics pipelines from the inner-workings of a GPU to the most front-end graphics API calls.
# Introduction
In this project I will implement a 3D graphics rasterizer that will contain the major features of modern graphics pipelines.
I will cover loading simple 3D model formats such as .OBJ, representing the loaded information as stored on modern computer systems then passing this data to the rasterizer engine that will project 3D points into a 2D image.
I hope to implement much more complex features such as:
+ Matrix stacking
+ Internal buffers such as to store depth information
+ Fragment shaders
+ Pixel shaders
